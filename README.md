### Author

<p align="justify">üë©‚Äçüíª The Dice Game is the result of taking part in a course on Udemy: 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann. The Java Script code comes from the course content.
To the general structure of the HTML code from the course I added my 'header' and 'footer'. The entire style and the responsiveness of the App was done by me (Barbara Carvalho).
