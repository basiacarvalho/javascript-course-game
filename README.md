## Overview

### The Project

A responsive, fun game of dice.

### Game Rules:

<p align="justify">

The game is for max 2 people (You can play against yourself or with another player).

An active player ‘rolls a dice’ and the numbers keep adding to the ‘round score’ area as points.

The active player can keep rolling the dice as much as he wants.

Each time, the active player can decide to roll a dice again or press a ‘hold’ button.

When pressing the ‘hold button’ the points from the ‘round score’ area are moved to the ‘total score’ area and it’s the next player’s turn.

If one of the players rolls number ‘1’, then all the points from the ‘round score’ area which haven’t been ‘hold’ are lost and it’s the opponent player’s turn.

The first player to reach 100 points in the ‘total score’ area wins the game.

### Author

<p align="justify">👩‍💻 The Dice Game is the result of taking part in a course on Udemy: 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann. The Java Script code comes from the course content.
To the general structure of the HTML code from the course I added my 'header' and 'footer'. The entire style and the responsiveness of the App was done by me (Barbara Carvalho).
